### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Despite the fact that I have almost 10 years in professional web development, most of the time I was working in agencies building different kind of websites. Working in web design agency means to be "Jack of all trades, master of none", and over time I realised that I need to focus on one thing, and master it. Now, my focus is backend development, primarily in PHP.  

Iâ€™m currently working as (remote) PHP developer in Rijeka (Croatia) based company 

Everyday tools and technologies I use are: Yii2 (PHP framework), Bootstrap (frontend framework), MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Git, SSH, YouTrack, WordPress 

My long-term goal is to become an even better developer (both backend and frontend). At the moment I consider myself as mid-level developer with aspiration to become senior PHP developer in under 5 years. 
 
Types of projects I have been working on:

- building and maintaining custom PHP applications like CRM, ERP, hotel booking, and other tailor-made projects
- creating/upgrading WordPress plugins
- website development using WYSIWYG editors: Elementor, Divi, Visual Composer, Beaver builder
- theme modifications to fit clients needs
- web shop development, maintenance and upgrading (Woocommerce, Magento, Drupal)
- custom post types for WordPress
- XML content export
- website optimization for: SEO, speed, security audits
- DNS management, domain management, hosting services
- content migration from and to WordPress (Laravel > WordPress, Drupal > WordPress)
- making the websites accessible for people with disabilities (according to WCAG 2.1.)
