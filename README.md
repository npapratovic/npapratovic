### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My focus is backend development, primarily in PHP.

Iâ€™m currently working as (remote) PHP developer in Slavonski Brod (Croatia) based company (with HQ in Cincinnati, OH - USA)

Everyday tools and technologies I use are: Laravel (PHP framework), Postman, MySQL, JavaScript (both Vanilla.js and React framework), Git, Gitlab, shell

My long-term goal is to become an even better developer (both backend and frontend). 

Types of projects I have been working on:

- building and maintaining custom PHP applications like CRM, ERP, hotel booking, and other tailor-made projects
- creating/upgrading WordPress themes & plugins
- website development using WYSIWYG editors: Elementor, Divi, Visual Composer, Beaver builder
- WordPress theme modifications to fit clients needs
- web shop development, maintenance and upgrading (Woocommerce, Magento, Drupal)
- custom post types for WordPress
- XML content export / import
- website optimization for: SEO, speed, security audits
- DNS management, domain management, hosting services
- content migration from and to WordPress (Laravel > WordPress, Drupal > WordPress)
- making the websites accessible for people with disabilities (according to WCAG 2.1.)
