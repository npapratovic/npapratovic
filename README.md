### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I have almost 10 years in professional web development, most of the time I was working in agencies building different kind of websites. 

Iâ€™m currently working as PHP developer in Rijeka (Croatia) based company 

Everyday tools and technologies I use are: Yii2 (PHP framework), Bootstrap (frontend framework), MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Git, SSH, YouTrack, WordPress as CMS (and almost all popular page builders -> Gutenberg, Elementor, Divi Builder, WPBakery, Visual Composer... )
