### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Despite the fact that I have almost 10 years in professional web development, most of the time I was working in agencies building different kind of websites. Working in web design agency means to be "Jack of all trades, master of none", and over time I realised that I need to focus on one thing, and master it. Now, my focus is backend development, primarily in PHP.  

Iâ€™m currently working as Backend PHP developer in Rijeka (Croatia) based company 

Everyday tools and technologies I use are: Yii2 (PHP framework), Bootstrap (frontend framework), MySQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Git, SSH, YouTrack, WordPress
