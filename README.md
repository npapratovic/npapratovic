### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

My focus is backend development, primarily in PHP.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working as (remote) PHP developer in Slavonski Brod (Croatia) based company (with HQ in Cincinnati, OH - USA)

Everyday tools and technologies I use are: Laravel (PHP framework), Postman, MySQL, JavaScript (both Vanilla.js and React framework), Git, Gitlab, shell

âš¡ My long-term goal is to become an even better developer (both backend and frontend).
